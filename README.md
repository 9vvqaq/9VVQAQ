# Hello, I'm [Tianyu Gao] 👋

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a 2027 fall undergraduate student engaged in research on **artificial intelligence applications** and **robotic perception**. My research focuses on the application of computer vision and anomaly detection in **engineering**, integrated circuits (**EDA**), **autonomous driving**, and **robotics**.

I'm very eager to connect with peers/PhDs! If you're interested in my research area (or if I have potential to become your student), please don't hesitate to reach out!

- 🎓 Currently: Sichuan University Automation (**Outstanding Engineer Program**)
- 🔬 Exchange Experience: **Clausthal University of Technology**, Germany; **Westlake University**, China  
- 💻 Selected Honors: **National Scholarship**, Sichuan University Comprehensive Scholarship
- 📧 Contact: [gaotianyu@stu.scu.edu.cn/2586810016@qq.com]
- Other Interests: Soccer, electronic music, modern orchestral music, Celtic music (his label won the 2023 Hollywood Best Recording Award; his solo track reached #23 on Beatport's Electronic Music Chart in April 2018)
